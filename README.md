# CrashCourseDataVisualization
This repository contains my attempts/projects aimed at learning Data Visualization in Python. 

These projects are from "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes.  The textbook guided readers through real-life python projects. 

If you have any questions about any of the projects in this repository, or the reasoning behind any of the code, please feel free to reach out to me! I would love to show/explain what I learned using this awesome text.
